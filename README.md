## What is Rich Statistics?

Rich Statistics is a self-hosted WordPress analytics plugin that collects publisher-useful metrics — operating system, browser, timezone, language, time on page, referrers, and more — without ever storing personally identifiable information.

Because no PII is collected and sessions are identified only with a `sessionStorage` UUID that dies with the browser tab, Rich Statistics sites **do not require cookie consent banners** under GDPR, CCPA, or ePrivacy Directive for the analytics data this plugin collects.

## Installation

### From richardkentgates.com (recommended)

1. Download the plugin from [richardkentgates.com](https://richardkentgates.com)
2. Upload the ZIP via **WordPress → Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**
3. Activate the plugin
4. Navigate to **Analytics** in the admin sidebar

> WordPress.org listing coming soon — it will be available there as well once approved.

### Manual / Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/richardkentgates/rich-statistics.git

# Run the build script to install dependencies and create the plugin ZIP
cd rich-statistics
bash build.sh

# The ZIP is created at ./build/rich-statistics-{version}.zip
# Upload that ZIP to WordPress
```

### Development Setup (without build)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/richardkentgates/rich-statistics.git
cd rich-statistics

# Install PHP dev dependencies
composer install

# Download Freemius SDK (required for premium features in production)
# The plugin loads a fallback stub in development when freemius/ is absent
```

---

## Configuration

After activation, navigate to **Rich Statistics → Preferences** in the WordPress admin to configure:

- **Data retention** — how many days of data to keep (1–730)
- **Bot score threshold** — sensitivity of bot detection (1–10)
- **Click tracking protocols** — which href protocols trigger click events
- **Click element selectors** — additional CSS IDs/classes to track

---

## Privacy & Compliance

Rich Statistics is designed to be **privacy-first**:

- **No cookies** — sessions use `sessionStorage` only (cleared when tab closes)
- **No PII** — IP addresses, full URLs with personal data, and email addresses are never stored
- **No third-party requests** — Chart.js is bundled locally; no CDN calls at runtime
- **Referrers truncated** — only the domain is stored, not the full referrer URL
- **Sensitive query params stripped** — any query parameter that looks like an email or is longer than 40 characters is removed from stored page paths
- **Self-hosted** — all data stays on your server

For detailed compliance information, see the [Privacy section of our documentation](https://statistics.richardkentgates.com#privacy).
